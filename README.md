#### Intro 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michaelah

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Graphic Design, UX/UI, Digital Marketing and Campaign Management

- âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, I love going on nature walks to discover different flowers, learn about their medicinal uses, and sketch them in my artbook! ðŸŒ¼

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Email Marketing on Hubspot,](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/email-marketing?library=true&library=true&q=email%20marketing) and [
ChatGPT and GPT-4 LLM Guide- Prompt Engineering for Everyone.](https://www.udemy.com/course/prompt-engineering-for-everybody/learn/lecture/37045136#overview)

- My favourite places to learn (at the moment) are: [Bring Your Own Laptop](https://www.youtube.com/@BringYourOwnLaptop) on Youtube, [Brainstation Live Event Panels](https://brainstation.io/events/online) with Experts, and [Wix Studio Live Events](https://www.wix.com/studio/academy/event). I really enjoy attending the live events, learning more from the experts, and submitting questions to the panel.
